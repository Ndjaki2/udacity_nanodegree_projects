# Udacity Nanodegree Projects
## by Ndjaki Ndjaki


## Introduction

This is a brief presentation of the first three projects I have worked on, as part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree


## Project 1

In the project named __Investigate a dataset__, I have worked on _The Movie Database_ (TMDb for short), originally taken from Kaggle; it contains information about a thousand movies, their revenue and user ratings, and used NumPy and pandas to go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.

## Project 2

This __Wrangle and Analyze data__ project is about wrangling _WeRateDogs_ Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations through web scraping and API requests gathering, assessing, and cleaning of the dataset.


## Project 3

1. This __Communicate Data Findings__ project has two parts that should demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

2. In Part I, __Exploratory data visualization__, I use Python visualization libraries to explore the _Ford-GoBike-TravelData_ data set, a San Francisco bike sharing system, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
In Part II, __Explanatory data visualization__, I make a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my exploration.
